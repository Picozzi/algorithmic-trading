# Stock Analysis and Algorithmic Trading

A web application that aggregates the top 10 mentioned stocks on the Reddit coommunity 'wallstreetbets' and performs sentiment analysis to determine whether overall sentiment of the stock is bullish or bearish.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this application was to create a way to integrate social media data into algorithmic trading. The current implementation simply aggregates and analyzes the most mentioned stocks. Future implementations will implement analysis into a moment strategy algorithm.
